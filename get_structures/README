==================================================
PREFACE
working directory must be get_structures
this won't work if a chain has >1 characters or if a pdb has more than 26 chains or 9999 residues 
this only downloads to first pdb to appear for each e value
youll need internet connection, mafft (or any alignment software if not using the automated mafft alignment), at least bash3.2.57 (POSIX), python3 (modules below). Feh is not needed, but used
python3 modules (pip3 lines for copy paste convenience)
	pip3 install os
	pip3 install biopython
	pip3 install pdb-tools
	pip3 install requests

brew lines for mac ("brew install" is replaced by "sudo apt-get" for linux)
	brew install gnuplot
	brew install mafft

note that using this script more than once every 10s or 100 times in 24hrs will get you temporarily blacklisted from BLAST
non-default blast parameters can be added in code/blast.py
==================================================
HOW TO USE
	edit master.sh to change variables 
	run desired step* files
==================================================
AUTOMATIC ALIGNMENT INFO (STEP 2)
	currently selected mafft alg:
		FFT-NS-2 algorithm 
	to change settings:
		open code/align_all.py
		change arguments in 'mafft_cline = MafftCommandline("mafft", input="alignment.fasta")' 
			settings in mafft section: https://biopython.org/docs/1.75/api/Bio.Align.Applications.html
			eg 'mafft_cline = MafftCommandline("mafft-linsi", input="alignment.fasta")' for L-INS-i alg
==================================================
TO DO
	implement $alltitles to get all pdbs for a matching seq
	extend to whole svd process and include master script for easy running of parts of or whole process
	detect double mcm in the same pdb file (chains A and 2)
