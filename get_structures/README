==================================================
PREFACE
working directory must be get_structures
this won't work if a chain has >1 characters or if a pdb has more than 26 chains or 9999 residues 
this only downloads to first pdb to appear for each e value

youll need:
internet connection, mafft (or any alignment software if not using the automated mafft alignment), at least bash3.2.57 (POSIX), python3 (modules below). Feh is not needed, but its called to display the plot. gnuplot is not needed for that matter, since you can just browse the output file that gnuplot is called to plot (the path will be printed to screen and log)
python3 modules (pip3 lines for copy paste convenience)
	pip3 install os
	pip3 install biopython
	pip3 install pdb-tools
	pip3 install requests
        pip3 install pandas
brew lines for mac ("brew install" is replaced by "sudo apt-get" for linux)
	brew install gnuplot
	brew install mafft

note that using this script more than once every 10s or 100 times in 24hrs will get you temporarily blacklisted from BLAST
    speaking of which, non-default blast parameters can be added in code/blast.py
note that step files aim to overwrite, so you should change the names of anything you want to preserve in the $label directory if youre repeating steps for the same label.
note that each step >1 uses a list file of PDB id's (ie the filename minus ".pdb"). If one wishes to discard a PDB from the proces
s, delete the PDB from the list that is feeding into the next step.
==================================================
HOW TO USE
	open and edit master.sh to assign variables 
	run desired step* files (in order) (eg "./step1.sh")
==================================================
AUTOMATIC ALIGNMENT INFO (STEP 3 for whole pdbs and STEP 5 for n-mers)
	currently selected mafft alg:
		FFT-NS-2 algorithm 
	to change settings:
		open code/align_all.py
		change arguments in 'mafft_cline = MafftCommandline("mafft", input="alignment.fasta")' 
			settings in mafft section: https://biopython.org/docs/1.75/api/Bio.Align.Applications.html
			eg 'mafft_cline = MafftCommandline("mafft-linsi", input="alignment.fasta")' for L-INS-i alg
==================================================
TO DO
	implement $alltitles to get all pdbs for a matching seq
	have step1 accept multiple chains in the ref fasta
